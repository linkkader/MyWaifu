Though befitting her role as a thief, she at times acts quite childish and mischievous when around the prospects of treasure.

She was a former candidate for the position of Hassan-i Sabbah, the pseudonym shared by the leaders of the League of Assassins, the Hashshashin. She was known as a particularly faithful girl in a certain country whose existence is referred to as \"merely a story.\" She underwent intense training to earn herself a name, and she was pious to the point in attempting to prove her faith that she was labelled as a \"zealot\" with despise by even those who worshipped the same God. While their group could be called a company of fanatics, her convictions were so beyond the norm that they earned her that title. She did not hate those who disparaged her because she believed the reason she was despised was because of her own immaturity and that her conviction was not firm.\n\nShe wished to become the sect’s leader, which required that she acquire power that could be called Divine Miracles. These Miracles had some unique specifications in that they must all quickly and reliably snuff out the lives of heretics and infidels. The leaders in the past obtained their titles by achieving numerous miracles worthy of bearing the name of the 19 angels that guard hell in the form of Zabaniya, so she continued her mad pursuit of self-improvement incessantly, seeking the miracles that were achieved by her predecessors. She recreated them one by one, but the World seemed to only shout “Still not enough” at her without pause. The other members were shocked by her achievements to the point where they could not believe what had happened. While she had achieved the miracles of all eighteen leaders in the past, no one in the sect acknowledged her right to inherit the leadership. It was her proof, soaked in blood and sweat, and she knew better than everyone what it really took to reach that point.\n\nThe faithfuls began to shun her, telling her that “What you achieved is no different from making copies of old tomes. You have not achieved your own Miracle, because there is still immaturity within you.” While she did lack the ability to innovate, their denial was only half of the reason. They feared her, she who learned all of those techniques in the span of a few years. Their final reasoning was that “You are still too young. We cannot have someone like you bearing the title of our leader.”, and although it was filled with nothing but excuses, she obeyed without question. She simply questioned her own faith, and believed herself to be juvenile in having defiled the secret techniques of their past leaders. She did not blame anyone, but still continued the quest for her own secret technique.\n\n“The Hundred-Faced One”, a man capable of resolving every single situation masterfully, eventually became the nineteenth leader, and upon recognizing his ability, Zabaniya: Delusional Illusion, was one she did not have, she was ashamed of her own immaturity rather than filled with envy. She did not fulfill anything in the end, nor did she receive any acknowledgement. She merely lived as a zealot, and she was not even allowed to be martyred for her faith. She spent her life meaninglessly until the end, but still bore the World no hatred. Still ashamed of her immaturity, she again dove into the whirlpool of faith because she has no emotions to allow her to bear a grudge. The only things she despised were the false idols of infidels, making her a zealot that no normal man could redeem. That is her whole story which merely disappeared into the abyss of history as that of another zealot, and while it should have ended there, it was reborn the instant when the zealot become the False Grail’s chosen.", "popularity": 18493, "like": 17006, "trash": 22239, "likeCount": 7, "trashCount": 1, "isWaifu": true, "serie": "*/Fate/strange fake"},

She presents a long series of bad habits such as pathological gambling, alcoholism, excessive consumption of cigarettes and cigars, reacting violently for no real reason, and forcing work on others. She usually is forgiven for each one thanks to her innocent little face and beauty, which often allows her to get what she wants. These tricks however don't work on her companions on the Bebop, whom she often fights with.\n\nShe behaves very provocatively and often tries to seduce men for her own benefit, but she claims to hate to feel desired and is rarely seen romantically interested in someone. Regarding her sexual orientation, she is usually labelled as straight, but in one occasion she kissed Ed on the mouth to awaken her from one of her fits.\n\nFaye basically doesn't trust anyone who claims to be able to live without suffering and is used to never stay too long in the same place because of her creditors. Although she remains as strong and indolent as possible, in reality she hides a big emotional vulnerability and often proves to nourish a lot of sympathy and empathy for her traveling companions.\n\nAlthough for the entire duration of the series the distinctive characteristics of Faye remain her sarcasm and presumption, her character noticeably develops. In fact, she begins to trust her companions, understand the value of friendship, learn to love, in her own way, to Jet and also to Ed. On different occasions she runs away from the Bebop frightened by her affection for her companions and having become used to the idea of \"leave before being abandoned,\" but she always duly returns, being the only place she can consider her \"home.\" This attitude, as noticed by Jet, often seems as a need of attention, as well as an attempt to prove her companions' affection for her.\n\nHer relationship with Spike is instead the most complex of the series. Most of the time they do nothing but bicker, but, in moments of danger, Faye has always shown concern for Spike, and Spike has shown some empathy for Faye's situation. Faye has also always taken care of Spike when he was injured, but she still kept a bitter attitude. The affection between them is quite obvious, and many have speculated the possibility that Faye could be in love with Spike. Watanabe has said on the subject, \"Sometimes I'm asked the question, 'What does Spike think of Faye?' I think that he likes her a little. But he's not a very simple person and makes sure not to show it\"", "popularity": 283, "like": 235, "trash": 1077, "likeCount": 803, "trashCount": 64, "isWaifu": true, "serie": "*/Cowboy Bebop"},

In retrospect, the two races could refer to the trolls and humans, since she was the first to contact the kids through the Furthest Ring.\n\nFeferi is almost entirely optimistic and fearless. Even when confronted by the horrorterrors that terrified both Karkat and Jade, Feferi remains gleeful and insists that they are not so bad once one gets to know them. Her tolerance towards them comes from the interactions with her monstrous lusus.\n\nFeferi is however rather condescending and seems to be masking a slightly rude and insulting side, which becomes a lot more apparent after her death, when she jokingly called Jade retarded for not knowing what a lusus was and called Jade stupid before pointing out she was dead.

Her attractive body and outer personality has caused many people to become infatuated with her either immediately or soon after contact.\n\n__Personality__\nOn the outside, Flare appears to be a kind, graceful and honest woman. She is able to become very popular due to her charms and beauty. In reality, Flare is unbelievably self-centered and thinks of herself as superior to everyone, especially to Keyaru, a mere farmer and a Hero with no offensive capabilities; because of the latter prejudice, she sees him as no more than a tool only useful for carrying the group's equipment, serving as a whipping boy, increasing the level cap of her servants and on occasion casting Heal. \nIncredibly sadistic, she tortured Keyaru at every turn, beat him regularly and forced him to do tricks like a dog in order to get the drug she got him addicted to. However, Flare is also cowardly, as she begged Keyaru for forgiveness after the latter manages to ambush her. \nAlthough manipulative enough to be able to conceal her true nature from the people of the Kingdom, she is ultimately portrayed as a rather clueless person, her own sister considering her useful solely as a weapon of mass destruction. When she sees Keyaru faint after healing Kureha, she immediately dismisses him as completely useless, and has to be told by her court mage that he has in fact performed some very high-level magic. Her arrogance is on full display once Keyaru strikes back against her, as even when she is completely at his mercy, she still behaves herself arrogantly towards him and insults him for being low-born, which only infuriates the Healer Hero even further.\n\nAfter being brainwashed, Freia is completely loyal to Keyaruga and genuinely in love with him. She is also much more kinder than her former self, as she treats Setsuna as a friend in spite of how her nation abuses demi-humans. \nIronically, she now displays a strong sense of justice and will be the first to claim that they have to save people whenever the Jhoiral Kingdom's forces abuse innocents. This amuses Keyaru to no end, as he knows what kind of person she used to be before this and feels like it's hypocritical for Freia to hold such views. \nBecoming an amnesiac has made Freia more naive than before. Keyaru even has to teach her how to use her spells properly, since even though she retained her knowledge on how to cast them, all of her experience with their use disappeared along with her memories. \nDespite her amnesia, Freia still harbors some traits of her former personality, such as her talent in manipulation and lying.

She has full lips and reddish eyes always shown wide open, something which, together with her tilted head, her perpetually raised eyebrows, and her semi-opened mouth, gives her a somewhat deranged appearance.

She is Felicia's elder twin sister. Flora is a more capable vassal than her sister, and is more serious in personality than her.\n\nUnlike her younger, clumsy twin sister, Flora is a skilled maid and always perform her tasks in a timely, flawless manner. The male Avatar notes that she is particularly hard working, but keeps her mood calm at all times. If she ever has strong emotions, she tends to let her ice powers go wild to help \"cool herself\", though it usually results in a large blizzard in the vicinity of her. Underneath her capable and professional exterior, she is a deeply insecure and troubled individual, having grave self-esteem and anxiety issues, and does not value her own life. In her S-support with a male Avatar, as well as her A-support with Felicia, it's revealed that her self-esteem issues stem from her ineptitude at fighting, and that the reason why she tries so hard at being a capable maid is because it gives her confidence. When it appears the Avatar is dismissing her from her job, she has a mild breakdown and states that if she were to quit being a maid, her life would have no meaning.\n\nOf their servants, she's the only character who is not devoted to their utmost to the Avatar. When Jakob tries to point out that she's renounced her vow of loyalty by betraying them in Conquest, Flora shoots back that she never swore loyalty to the Avatar in the first place, only being made to serve them due to being a prisoner. In Birthright, Flora lashes out at the Avatar during their battle dialogue, exclaiming that they do not even know her real self. After the Avatar proves how much they care for her when they go out of their way to avoid harming her and the other Ice tribe members in their battle, Flora is so touched she insists on retaking her vow of loyalty, and from then on truly devotes herself to the Avatar.\n\nWhile Felicia looks up to her for her flawless maid skills, Flora is envious of Felicia for her stronger fighting skills. Flora feels that Felicia is stronger in character, as she is willing to always stay by the Avatar's side, refusing to back down to intimidation. In both Birthright and Revelation, out of fear for her own life and her people's safety, she decided to go against her former liege and sister so King Garon would not execute her and the Ice Tribe.

Several locks framed her face and hung in front of her forehead. She wore the standard Claymore uniform and had silver eyes like the rest of the Claymores. She had a child-like face and was considered to be exceptionally beautiful.\nHeight: 180cm (5ft 10.86).Flora was very soft-spoken and obediently followed orders from her superiors. She became Miria's second-in-command during the Northern Campaign due to her being the highest-ranked warrior after Miria. Unlike most other Claymores (such as Helen) who speak bluntly and informally, Flora always used polite language and a gentle tone of voice, even when she was trying to impose tight discipline on Miria's behalf.", "popularity": 10397, "like": 9059, "trash": 17863, "likeCount": 23, "trashCount": 2, "isWaifu": true, "serie": "*/Claymore"},

Having the original prototype being rush produced, the FNC suffered from many mechanical failures, it was withdrawn from the NATO standardization trial at an early stage. An updated prototype was developed during 1981–1982 and took part in a trial hosted by the Swedish Military, which achieved satisfactory feed backs from the both the Swedes and Belgian Army.\n\nFNC operates on a gas-operated, rotating bolt mechanism with a long stroke gas piston. Designed to feed from 30-round STANAG magazines, the FNC fires at a rate of 700 rounds per minute, able to reach an effective firing range of up to 400 metres. FNC's fire selector can switch the rifle into semi-automatic, 3-round burst and fully automatic mode of fire.

He was a common burglar who pretended to sell newspapers as a front for learning when people left their homes.\n\nDuring one of his burglaries, Sahwit was caught in the act by the owner of the apartment, Cindy Stone. He picked up the nearest thing he could find, a clock-statue of \"The Thinker\", and hit her over the head with it. The 12-hour clock then spoke the time - 1:00 - which Sahwit believed was the real time. Stone died of blood loss, and Sahwit decided to frame her ex-boyfriend Larry Butz, who had visited her apartment on the day of the murder.\n\nDuring Butz's subsequent trial, Sahwit was called as the sole witness to the murder. While acting in a very sycophantic way throughout, he claimed that he had found Stone at 1:00 p.m. However, the autopsy report contradicted this by placing the time of death as 4:00 p.m. Sahwit tried to explain why he had been so sure of the time, without revealing the truth, but his testimony was full of holes that he eventually ended up giving testimony that contradicted his earlier statements. Butz's rookie defense attorney, Phoenix Wright, exploited these flaws and, upon confirming that the clock-statue was three hours behind, soon accused Sahwit of the murder.\n\nIn response, Sahwit threw his toupée at Wright and revealed his real, rage-filled nature. He claimed that Wright could not prove that the clock was three hours slow at the time of the murder. However, Wright - with the aid of his mentor, Mia Fey - explained that the victim had gone to France the day before the murder, meaning that the clock was actually nine hours ahead. At this, Sahwit hyperventilated and collapsed on the stand.

She is also known as Silent Roar. She is the Puppeteer of Rabbi, and several other canine Automatons.Frey is a young lady, of average stature, and has a large bosom. She has white hair and red eyes, characteristic of a Promised Child. Her fringe is messy and of uneven lengths, framing her face. Just behind her left ear, she braids her hair; the braid is then tied into a high pony tail with the rest of her hair on the right side of her head. She puts on pink tie ribbons above her ears, while an additional black tie ribbon is used for her pony tail on the right.\nWith regards to her outfit, she wears the standard uniform as a student of the Academy. Additionally, she also drapes a purple scarf around her shoulders, which is held together with a gold pin. Due to her large bosom, her white blouse is revealing as it is not buttoned up. In the anime, she is depicted as having one small belt buckled around each upper arm, while this detail is not consistently shown in the manga. Meanwhile in the light novel, she is shown at least having a buckled belt on her right arm. The cuffs are also depicted differently: in the light novel, her cuffs flow freely with a small slit on the sides, while the manga has her cuffs drawn as folded and buttoned with cuff links.\n\nLike other female students in the Academy, she puts on a black vest that emphasizes the chest. She wears a gray skirt, black thigh highs with suspenders, and buckled gray boots.Family means everything to Frey, including her canine Automatons. When her parents were still alive, she had a loving relationship with them. Sadly after their deaths, she had immense guilt and blamed herself for causing their deaths because she believed she was responsible for the “accident” that killed them. Subsequently, she blamed herself for causing Loki to be chosen as Cherubim’s puppeteer. For many years, she thought that Loki hated her, and thus, the only family member she could confide her feelings in was Rabbi, her main canine Automaton. Her great love for her dogs has compelled her to the point that she attempted to assassinate Raishin, believing that Bronson would fulfil his promise and let her live with her beloved dogs again. After finding out that Yomi has died, she grieves for her, but does not blame Raishin. Instead, she thanks him for freeing her in what would be the last day of her life. Later on, she discovers the truth about her parents’ deaths, and is greatly devastated. However, thanks to Charlotte Belew’s assurance, she soon realizes that Loki never hated her, instead he was always looking out for her, albeit in a slightly cold fashion.\nFrey is also helpful to Raishin. For example, she provides him with information of Henriette Belew’s identity, Charlotte’s disappearance, and so forth. She has helped to deliver lunches to him when he and Loki were hospitalised. She offers her help generously in finding Henriette, before the latter attempts suicide again. When Henriette expresses how confused and helpless she feels, Frey takes care of her by giving her the same assurance and care that Raishin gave to her when he decided to get involve and help her to defeat Bronson.\n\nIn several comical situations, Frey has also been shown to be rather clumsy, and clueless about things, such as getting trapped in her own traps, and accidentally blurting out that Raishin may be part of their family in future, which in turn hints of her feelings towards him.", "popularity": 4717, "like": 3913, "trash": 14054, "likeCount": 72, "trashCount": 4, "isWaifu": true, "serie": "*/Unbreakable Machine-Doll (Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai)"},

His title is Ultimate Yakuza.\n\nFuyuhiko is initially incredibly stand-offish and rude to the other students on the island. He claims he's not going to play at being friends with anyone, and when he is questioned about this, he states clearly that he would not hesitate to kill anyone of the others. He makes frequent references to his yakuza background and seems adamant at presenting this sort of \"lone wolf\" attitude. Fuyuhiko doesn't simply want to make friends but considers it not worth his time and beneath him. Despite this, as early as chapter 1, he shows signs of this perhaps not being all true, with him \"happening to walk by\" the lodge where the other students were having a party, despite claiming that he had no interest in going.\n\nAfter deciding to change in Chapter 3, because of Peko's sacrifice and him realizing his own mistakes, Fuyuhiko became more sociable and avoided bad-mouthing people to the best of his abilities. He even seems to become one of the group's most loyal and steadfast members, though still short-tempered and impulsive. He tries to help others and is shown to openly care about them.\n\nIn his free-time events, Fuyuhiko is revealed to have self-esteem issues concerning his status as the Ultimate Yakuza and the clan's heir. He does not believe he deserves the title, though he grows out of this with Hajime's company. He states that he wants to be strong on his own, and not to simply rely on his family's power to get ahead in life. His goal is to be strong enough to lead his family, rather than to be strong because he leads his family. Because of his insecurities, he is also particularly sensitive about his appearance, as people would expect a big, muscular man to lead a yakuza family, and Fuyuhiko's appearance is the opposite of that. It is suggested that it would not be out of the question for him to react violently if someone were to use the word \"baby face\" in reference to him. It's also revealed that Fuyuhiko enjoys eating sweets, such as fried dough cookies, which he considers unmanly and shameful and thus tries to keep it a secret. He is also ashamed because he doesn't have any tattoos like \"real yakuza\" do.\n\nFuyuhiko takes duty very seriously, and if there's someone who he can trust, he will open his heart and cooperate with them. Despite being a yakuza, deep down he has a somewhat pure heart and he's very strict to the rules.

It was accepted into service with the Bundeswehr in 1997, replacing the G3. The G36 is gas-operated and feeds from a 30-round detachable box magazineor 100-round C-Mag drum magazine.\n\nWork on a successor for the venerable G3 rifle had been ongoing in Germany since the second half of the 1970s. These efforts resulted in the innovative 4.73mm G11 assault rifle (developed jointly by a group of companies led by H&K), that used caseless ammunition (designed by the Dynamit Nobel company). It had been predicted that this weapon would eventually replace the G3, therefore further development of H&K's series of firearms chambered for the5.56×45mm NATO cartridge had been halted. Heckler & Koch, having no incentive to pursue a new 5.56 mm weapon system, was content with the export-oriented HK33 and G41 rifles. However, the G11 program came to an abrupt end when the Bundeswehr cancelled its procurement due to defence budget cuts after the unification of East and West Germany and H&K was acquired in 1991 by British Aerospace's Royal Ordnance division (known today as BAE Systems).\n\nIncreasing interest in Germany for a modern service rifle chambered for the NATO-standard 5.56 mm cartridge led H&K to offer the German armed forces the G41 rifle, which, too, was rejected. Design work was then initiated from the ground up on a modern 5.56 mm assault rifle designated \"Project 50\" or HK50. The prototype was then trialed, where it was rated higher than the rival Austrian Steyr AUG system.  The final version of the G36 was completed in 1995. Production of the G36 began in 1996.\n\nThe HK50 rifle was selected for service and an initial order was placed for 33,000 rifles under the Bundeswehr designation Gewehr G36. The order also involved an option for a further 17,000 rifles. Deliveries were first made to the Bundeswehr's NATO Quick Reaction Force during the fourth quarter of 1997.

Gaige was added as post-release downloadable content released on October 9, 2012 for $9.99 USD / 800 Microsoft points / $14.40 AUS. Those who pre-ordered Borderlands 2 received the character free of charge. Her skill grants her the ability to control the D374-TP, or Deathtrap. She is also used as a marketing tool outside of Borderlands 2 where the character chats on Twitter and releases ECHO logs.\n\nGaige was a high school student from the planet Eden-5. She originally conceived Deathtrap, then called DT, as a science fair project to combat bullying. Her rival, Marcie Holloway, was a contestant in the science fair as well, and used her father's money to buy her way through the competition. Marcie apparently stole Gaige's DT designs and sold them to Eden-5's police force.\n\nOn the day of the science fair, Marcie's father bribed the judges, helping win her first place with a defective robot based on Deathtrap's blueprints. Gaige placed third. Marcie then shoved Gaige, causing Deathtrap to identify her as a hostile. Deathtrap attacked with its claws, causing her to explode due to a miscalibration by Gaige. Gaige was escorted to the principal's office, and faced expulsion and arrest for accidentally murdering her rival. She called her father to create a distraction to help her evade arrest, and bought a ticket to Pandora, where she stowed away on a train leading to Windshear Waste.", "popularity": 2321, "like": 1987, "trash": 6104, "likeCount": 150, "trashCount": 11, "isWaifu": true, "serie": "*/Borderlands (Franchise)"},

The maintenance of this system is his primary driving force throughout the series and as a result, shows disappointment when Class E surpasses the other classes.\n\nAlthough he prioritizes the maintenance of his system above all else, he also seems to desire to prove his methods are indeed correct, so he never tampers with scores that have already been earned. For example, for the second trimester exams, he encourages the teachers to ramp up their difficulty to be akin to a college or university exam so that his students may compete with Class E on a level befitting their educational prowess. For those very exams, he allows the honest placement of the top students and grades without modifying or censoring them, showing the exact outcome of his educational bout with Korosensei, even though the outcome was unfavorable to him.

He is the father of Xander, Camilla, Leo, Elise, the stepfather of Azura, the husband of his first wife Katerina and the second husband of Arete, his second wife, and the paternal grandfather of Siegbert and Forrest. Following his murder of Sumeragi, he kidnapped a young Corrin and made them his adoptive child. He confined them to the Northern Fortress where they were raised alone. Due to Nohr's horrible weather and poor crop yields, he orders his children to invade Hoshido. He is ambitious and has a lust for power, and is always suspicious of others. His attempts to attack Hoshido were stopped by a magical barrier placed by Hoshido's queen Mikoto, which robbed any Nohrian soldier of any will to fight if they passed through it.\n\nSeveral support conversations between the Nohrian siblings reveal that in his youth, he had a very different demeanor towards his children, being a doting and loving father. However, he also frequently indulged in his rather harmful passions, did not take responsibility for his actions, and never could leave a woman he'd once loved. As a result, his many mistresses began jockeying for his favor, often turning to violence in the process. It's thought that this unhappy family life is what eventually hardened him into the person he is at the start of the game. Furthermore, it is also revealed that he also visited the Rainbow Sage when he was younger, and thus received power from him.\n\nGaron personally released Hans (who had been arrested by Xander prior to the events of the game) after he \"rehabilitated\" in prison. He also offered Gunter power (this power being Anankos' vessel), but he refused. This resulted in him ordering the destruction of Gunter's village.", "popularity": 20378, "like": 21930, "trash": 15208, "likeCount": 3, "trashCount": 3, "isWaifu": false, "serie": "*/Fire Emblem"},

At the start of the series his rivalry with Satoshi becomes a recurring motif. Like the video games, manga and anime, Shigeru is described as an overconfident and arrogant trainer who's knowledge of Pokemon stems from being the grandson of Professor Okido. As Satoshi's rival, he always seems to be a few steps ahead of Satoshi, much to Satoshi's chagrin.\n\nPrior to his introduction, Shigeru usually comes off as an arrogant show-off in the beginning. However, his personality begins to change as he matures. Later on in the series, he grows into a nicer and more humble person in both the anime and the video games. Throughout most of the series, he and Satoshi have an ongoing rivalry through most of the Kanto and Johto League sagas. However, this would soon diminish at later point. After his crushing defeat at the Indigo Plateau Pokemon League, his attitude towards Ash, who finished in the top sixteen far ahead of his rival, changes significantly after this turning point. His dealings with Pokemon seem to mature, as he starts travelling alone, wanting to better reestablish himself as a trainer.\n\nHis rivalry with Satoshi comes to a head at the Johto Leaue Silver Conference semi-finals, both trainers giving it their all, with Satoshi narrowly coming out the victor. After his lost, he then decides to no longer compete for the same goal as Satoshi, but instead dedicate his career into Pokemon research. Although no longer Satoshi's rival, he does tend to motivate Satoshi on ways of bettering himself as a trainer, at times scolding Satoshi when becoming overconfident over his wins particularly in the Orange League and Battle Frontier. In a sense, Shigeru is what urges Satoshi to start yet another new journey by traveling to the different regions across the world, such as Johto and Sinnoh. Despite his many absences in the series, Shigeru continues to remain a vital character, and one of Satoshi's most valued friends. He is bound to make more appearances during the Diamond and Pearl Saga, since he seems to have decided to be both a Pokémon trainer and a Pokémon researcher there. He guest-appears in episode forty-five of the Diamond and Pearl series helping to preserve a group of highly endangered Shieldon with Professor Rowan and his team.", "popularity": 3721, "like": 6080, "trash": 1180, "likeCount": 42, "trashCount": 60, "isWaifu": false, "serie": "*/Pokemon (Root Series)"},

As a result, Gazelle began to mimic Kaito and took on a lot of his personality traits, and eventually fell in love with him. A sentiment which he reciprocated. Later, when Nike found her again, Gazelle revealed that she is a Brain Charger. She battled Nike and seemed to gain an upper hand, but lost when faced with the combined powers of both Nike and Sora.

He had little interest in the family's illegal businesses, and although he excelled at and enjoyed his ninja training, he spent most of his time pursuing a playboy lifestyle. Many within the clan considered the carefree Genji to be a dangerous liability, and they resented his father for coddling and protecting him. Following the clan leader's untimely death, Genji's older brother, Hanzo, demanded that Genji take a more active role in their late father's empire. Genji refused, enraging Hanzo. The tension between the brothers built to a violent confrontation that left Genji on the verge of dying.\n\nHanzo believed that he had killed his brother, but Genji was rescued by Overwatch and the intervention of Dr. Angela Ziegler. The global force saw Genji as a potential asset in its ongoing operations to combat the Shimada clan. As Genji's injuries left him clinging to life, Overwatch offered to rebuild his body in exchange for his help. He was put through an extensive process of cyberization, which enhanced his natural speed and agility and augmented his superlative ninja skills. Transformed into a living weapon, Genji single-mindedly set about the task of dismantling his family's criminal empire.\n\nBut as time passed, Genji felt increasingly at war with himself. He was repulsed by the mechanical parts of his body and could not come to grips with what he had become. When his mission was complete, he abandoned Overwatch and wandered the world in search of meaning. He drifted for many years before crossing paths with the omnic monk Zenyatta. Though Genji initially rejected Zenyatta's wisdom, the benevolent omnic would not be deterred. In time, Zenyatta became his mentor, and under the monk's tutelage, Genji reconciled his dual existence as both man and machine. He learned to accept that although he had a cyborg body, his human soul was intact, and he came to see his new form as a gift and a unique strength.\n\nNow, for the first time in his life, Genji is free.

This allows for the GM6 to potentially be fired from the off hand, something almost unheard of for a rifle in this caliber. Also helping to achieve this is the rifle's surprisingly light recoil. The GM6 has substantially less recoil than other .50 BMG rifles, owing to the gun's unique barrel design and long recoil system. \n\nPersonality: Her first impression is being refreshingly frank and direct, the showy and outspoken sort who can get along well with everyone.

Like his counterpart fusion Vegito, he is regarded as one of the most powerful characters in the entire Dragonball franchise, and can turn Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan Blue. In Dragonball GT, he also has made an appearance as Super Saiyan 4.\n\nAs a fusion of Goku and Vegeta, Gogeta is a combination of their characteristics, retaining Goku's tall physique and Vegeta's stern facial features. Like other Metamoran fusions, he dons a black vest with reddish-orange padding and a dark blue belt. First shown in his Super Saiyan form, his hairstyle resembles Vegeta's, though Gogeta's hair is longer and wider, sporting an additional bang down his forehead. In Fusion Reborn and Dragon Ball GT, Gogeta retains Vegeta's widow's peak and Goku's lighter skin complexion, while in Dragon Ball Super: Broly, he lacks the widow's peak and sports Vegeta's mildly tan skin instead, along with jet-black hair with the reveal of his base form. His Metamoran outfit also more closely resembles his son Gotenks', the padding on his vest being yellow instead of orange and his belt a distinct shade of teal instead of dark blue. \n\nWhen it comes to his personality, it's impossible to tell which counterpart's personality is the dominant one or a composite of both Goku and Vegeta, but in terms of humor and a lesser tough attitude, Gogeta acts and uses catchphrases like Goku.\n\nHowever, in Fusion Reborn, Gogeta is shown in a cold fashion, barely speaking during his fight with Janemba and opting to swiftly eradicate him instead of playing around. He chuckles after seeing the monster revert back to the Saike Demon, hinting that Gogeta is not as stern as he comes off.\n\nIn GT, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta's personality greatly resembles Vegito's, as he is shown to enjoy toying with Omega Shenron to the point of pulling absurd pranks, though his overconfidence results in his unexpected defusion due to his fusion time being shortened by the power of Super Saiyan 4. However, Gogeta is shown to have a reason behind pranking Omega, as it is his prank that incites Omega into launching the Negative Karma Ball and gives Gogeta the opening to purify it and disperse the negative energy surrounding the Earth.\n\nIn Broly, Gogeta displays mixed traits of his Fusion Reborn and GT selves, almost always seen with a confident, almost arrogant smirk on his face, but remaining practical and efficient, more so than Vegito. He rarely speaks during his battle with Broly, only taunting briefly before resuming his attacks. In a similar vein to Vegeta, Gogeta can be ruthless once he had determined a foe to be a threat, and will show no mercy or hesitation in eliminating them as demonstrated during the climax of his battle with Broly. However, he still retains Goku's benevolence, as after Broly was no longer a threat and teleported away, Gogeta merely smirked and ceased his attempt on Broly's life. Additionally, he merely restrained Frieza from firing upon Cheelai and Lemo's ship, rather than killing him as he easily could have. He also retains Goku's respectful nature, such as referring to Whis as \"Whis-san\".", "popularity": 23507, "like": 24621, "trash": 17172, "likeCount": 2, "trashCount": 2, "isWaifu": false, "serie": "*/Dragon Ball"},

Golden Girl, is the true heroine of the story. She's passionate about her work, but much more practical about it than her mentor. A talented acrobat, before puberty set in she was able to jump, swing, flip, and parkour with the best of them; she also trained in boxing, so her punches pack a wallop. Her ample chest is filtered from the perception of every single person in the setting who doesn't have immunity to the Comic Code. She herself has full immunity and just rolls with anything she finds out of place to the best of her abilities. Her chest is only ever a source of physical comedy and is never acknowledged by anyone other than her own thoughts or her rival. \n\nPersonality\n\nAudrey can best be described as plucky. She has a good head on her shoulders and excels at technical tasks and research, but struggles to keep up with Sarah's banter and word play. Self-conscious is another word that aptly describes her; before puberty she was very confident in her abilities, but after her development, she finds herself having doubts due to having to learn how to fight all over again and rediscover her center of gravity. \n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\nAudrey Page was a normal girl growing up in Platinum City. Her father was famed war hero and ace pilot \"Black\" Jack Page. Having lost her mother at a young age, she grew up a tomboy, learning to work on engines and how to scrap with the best of the boys! But tragedy struck when her father was killed in a terrible crash during an air race. Happening to overhear some suspicious men who had wandered into her father's hanger/garage, she discovered that her father had been murdered by some local mobsters for refusing to cooperate with their match fixing scheme!\n\nAfter narrowly escaping the racketeers that killed her old man, Audrey wandered, too scared to go home. She eventually fell in with a traveling carnival when she helped the wife of the manager catch a pickpocket. Audrey took to the traveling life with gusto. She even learned tumbling and some acrobatics from some of the side performers.\n\nWhen her new life was threatened by more mobsters who were putting the squeeze on her new family, she knew she had to act! Sneaking around she managed to track the crooks to their hide out. Not really knowing what to do she got closer to hear their plans but, being a novice, got caught. She put up a tremendous fight but it wasn't enough. Just when it seemed like lights out, a luminous figure crashed through the window: the heroine Silver Queen! Handily dispatching the thugs, the crime-fighter freed the young girl.\n\nWary that the associates of these criminal fiends would come after the circus folk now that they knew they harbored someone who knew the details of their crimes, Silver Queen adopted Audrey to protect her and her friends.\n\nThe Golden Sidekick\n\nAfter some initial awkwardness as the glamorous socialite/nocturnal crime fighter and the orphan circus brat got familiar with each other, Silver Queen had an inspired idea. Impressed with Audrey's fighting spirit and skills, she invited her to join in the never-ending fight to rid their city of corruption and crime! Inspired by her fathers gold medal for heroism in the war and her new mentors namesake metal, Audrey took on the name Golden Girl!

He refrained from judging others until he saw what they were like face-to-face.

He is the Biomatch for Biometal Model A.\n\nPersonality.\nGrey's personality is influenced by his experiences over the course of the game. Being rescued by people who didn't know him, Grey is inspired by this act of kindness to do the same for others, even if they are enemies; Grey openly demonstrates this with his willingness to save the Raiders from an attack by Atlas. Another influence comes from Aile's advice, which encourages Grey to leave his past behind him and focus on making his own future. Because he has no experience interacting with others, Grey has no insight on proper mannerisms (as noted by the Sage Trinity as well as Aile), which makes him seem a little rude at times. Model A in particular describes Grey as \"a tough-talking stubborn kid\" and \"a kind, crazy fool\". Despite being paired with Model A, Grey is somewhat like Model X due to the fact they both believe that there shouldn't be a reason to save innocent people. He never smiles throughout the game until the ending of the game.\n\nBecause of the premature end of his brainwashing as a result of the Maverick ambush at the Mysterious Lab, Grey spent most of the game with amnesia.\n\nIn the manga, unlike his game counterpart, Grey is rather childish and somewhat gullible. He is very obedient to Ashe, never complaining to her demand and whole-heartedly follows her wishes, though he occasionally also like teasing her even if it means receiving the end of her punches. He has fondness for sweets or any delicious foods, comically always being shown drooling whenever he sees or smells one.\n\nHistory/Mega Man ZX Advent.\n(displayed like this on wiki for odd reasons)\nHe first appears within stasis in the Mysterious Lab, and is awakened by a battle between Hunters and Galleons, not knowing who he was or anything about his world. His eyes turn back from red to green since the mind control sequence was stopped from becoming a Megaman that would fight alongside with Albert. Pandora finds him and proclaims him as \"Defective\", explaining that she has to kill him. However, he grabs a gun from a fallen Hunter, fires on her, and escapes. He is knocked out after fighting Dogu the Giant when the bridge he is standing on collapses.\n\nHe is later found by the Hunter Billy, who takes him to Hunter Camp, where he is given a Hunter's License and asked to help escort the Model A Biometal to Legion. However, Prometheus and Pandora attack the train carrying it, and the Biometal responds to Grey. They Megamerge, and the pair allows him to join the \"Game of Destiny\". Shortly after, Grey discovers the power of A-Trans after defeating the Pseudoroid, Buckfire  (Diaburn in the Japanese version). Model A, though unsure of assisting Grey, decides to tag along for his own safety.\n\nHe is then given an invitation by the Sage Trinity to visit Legion, the most powerful organization in the world in order to inspect Model A. During his venture, he encounters four other Mega Men, Aeolus, Atlas, Thetis and Siarnaq, who wields the Biometals, H, F, L and P, respectively. He first fights against Atlas and manages to defeat her before she harvests the souls of a stray group of Raiders to Model W and in the process, breaks a cipher, revealing secret encoded data about the Model W. Grey then finally heads to Legion but is temporarily stopped short by Siarnaq, but is also defeated, resulting in another cipher, this time, showing a vague figured as well as a hint as to the creator of Model W, who appears to be one of the Sage Trinity. Though Model A is unsure at this point, Grey continues on ahead for the truth. The perpetrator appears to be none other than Albert, who is seen with several Model W fragments and escapes Grey's attack, but not before telling him he was 'made in his image'.\n\nDuring his missions for Legion, Grey unlocks more ciphers after defeating the four Mega Men he met earlier while traveling to Legion. After completing the new destination Master Thomas had added to the transerver, he then encounters Aile in the Quarries, along with a Model W. Grey demands Aile to step away from the Model W, but Aile refuses and Double-Megamerges with Model X and Model Z. She decides to challenge Grey for the Model W. After Aile's defeat, Grey unlocks the final cipher, revealing data of Albert's goal to combine all the Model Ws forming the ultimate Biometal, Ouroboros.\n\nLater on, he discovers that he was made as an \"Alternate body\" for Albert, who created Model A, also known as Model Albert. After Grey defeats Albert, he then collapses. Meanwhile, during the fight between Aile and the four Mega Men, Model Z insists that Aile has to go rescue Grey while he stalls the enemies. It is unknown whether Model Z survived the fall of Ouroboros. After Grey wakes up at Hunters' Camp and finishes his conversation with Aile, he and Model A go explore the world in search of their destinies.\n\nMegaman ZX Advent Manga.\nGrey is the protagonist of the story and the Biomatch for Model A. He and Model A are employed by Ashe to be her bodyguards in her treasure hunting, protecting her whenever there's Maverick Reploids or Mechaniloids getting their way while looking for treasure. Although, most of the times, Grey, together with Model A, acts more like Ashe's errand boy, doing things like carrying all her luggages or looking for foods for them while Ashe is sleeping.", "popularity": 24970, "like": 25106, "trash": 20505, "likeCount": 1, "trashCount": 1, "isWaifu": false, "serie": "*/Mega Man"},

They wear white robes with their sleeves fasten to their wrists and a hakama tied together with an obi bearing a gem.\n\nGui Fa keeps their self calm and composed but is extremely shy around others, preferring to cover their face with a book at all times to make sure that no one sees them. According to Mei, Gui Fa was shy even in the past and has noted that it has gotten worse over time.

The only rare times Gui Fa is willing to show their face to others is if they were to engage in important matters or make a bold statement.\n\nAs a Tensen, Gui Fa has no sympathy towards humans and only sees them as material to create Tan. Gui Fa even admitted that they believe that their kind and humans are incapable of coming to an understanding as that they found Sagiri's attempt at a negotiation to be pointless. They also believe that as a Tensen they harbor no feelings of emotion, such as wanting to form bonds with others, and that they and the other members of Lord Tensen (including Mei) are only beings that are meant \"to seek the way\".

Although this was the case, after hearing Mei explain how she learned what life meant during her time with Hōko, Gui Fa did admit that they felt a sense of envy towards her.\n\nUnlike the other Tensens (with Zhu Jin as an exception), Gui Fa prefers to take the Middle Way in that they do not side with one gender. As such, Gui Fa maintains a body that showcases both sexes. Because of this point of view, Gui Fa finds the Bōchū Jutsu training to be ridiculous and believes that their method is more effective.", "popularity": 25273, "like": 26009, "trash": 17103, "likeCount": 0, "trashCount": 2, "isWaifu": true, "serie": "*/Hell's Paradise"},

As a result of Guinevere's mother being the woman Desmond had originally intended to marry and Zephiel's mother being the woman he had been forced to marry, Desmond blatantly favored Guinevere over Zephiel, desiring Guinevere's husband to take the throne of Bern.\n\nThe feud between Desmond and Hellene grew to the point that Hellene and Zephiel had been moved to a mansion outside the castle's premises, whilst Desmond and Guinevere lived in the castle. Despite this Zephiel tried to visit Desmond and Guinevere as much as he could, Guinevere dearly loved her brother and didn't understand her father's hostility to his son.\n\nOn one occasion when Zephiel visited his father and Guinevere under the pretense that the latter was sick(a lie from Desmond), a healthy Guinevere was gifted a fox cub by her brother. Despite Zephiel's attempt to connect to his father, Desmond was enraged to see the two siblings and thought Zephiel was trying to steal Guinevere from him. \n\n Fire Emblem: Binding Blade\n\nAs her brother grew, so did his popularity among Bern, Desmond came to feel Guinevere's chances of ascending to be Bern's ruler were being threatened. This led to Desmond setting a trap for Zephiel, pretending to accept his son, Desmond offered him a cup of poisoned wine. Faking his death and funeral, Zephiel killed his father. While Guinevere's young age meant she didn't comprehend the full situation, she noticed her brother was never the same afterwards.\n\nIn the face of her brother's actions, Guinevere went to Roy for help when she saw that Zephiel had gone too far. Unlike her older brother, she does not want a war to happen, and she still remembers how well they got along as children, before King Desmond attempted to kill Zephiel.\n\nTogether with her lady-in-waiting, the cleric Elen, Princess Guinivere joins Roy early in the game in an effort to stop Zephiel. Eventually, she becomes the queen of Bern after Zephiel's defeat, despite the protests of some aristocrats.\n\nGuinivere is usable on the trial maps of Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade once the player has completed the game nine times, and one of them in hard mode.", "popularity": 17594, "like": 17425, "trash": 14047, "likeCount": 6, "trashCount": 3, "isWaifu": true, "serie": "*/Fire Emblem"},

Their crew numbered 240 officers and enlisted men. The ships measured 118.5 meters (388 ft 9 in) overall, with a beam of 10.8 meters (35 ft 5 in) and a draft of 3.76 meters (12 ft 4 in). They displaced 2,065 metric tons (2,032 long tons) at standard load and 2,529 metric tons (2,489 long tons) at deep load. The ships had two Kampon geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Kampon water-tube boilers. The turbines were rated at a total of 52,000 shaft horsepower (39,000 kW) for a designed speed of 35 knots (65 km/h; 40 mph). The ships had a range of 5,000 nautical miles (9,300 km; 5,800 mi) at a speed of 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph).\n\nThe main armament of the Kagerou class consisted of six Type 3 127-millimeter (5.0 in) guns in three twin-gun turrets, one superfiring pair aft and one turret forward of the superstructure. They were built with four Type 96 25-millimeter (1.0 in) anti-aircraft guns in two twin-gun mounts, but more of these guns were added over the course of the war. The ships were also armed with eight 610-millimeter (24.0 in) torpedo tubes for the oxygen-fueled Type 93 \"Long Lance\" torpedo in two quadruple traversing mounts; one reload was carried for each tube. Their anti-submarine weapons comprised 16 depth charges.\n\nParticipating in the Battle of Midway, the heavily damaged aircraft carrier Kaga was scuttled by Hagikaze's two torpedoes, Kaga being fatally damaged by US aircraft from USS Enterprise during the battle.\n\nOn 7 August 1943, Hagikaze was sunk between Kolombangara and Vella Lavella (07°50′S 156°55′E) during the Battle of Vella Gulf, by torpedoes and gunfire from the US destroyers USS Dunlap, USS Craven, and USS Maury, with 178 killed.\n\nHagikaze has a cheerful, eager, but feminine personality. She notably has an aversion to the night, especially night battles. Probably due to her historical sinking in a disastrous night ambush. Her hourly and seasonal lines also show a weakness towards healthy food.\n\nShe has yellow eyes and long purple hair with an ahoge. Her hair is tied into a side ponytail similar to Kaga's, continuing a Kantai Collection trend of matching a few traits from escort ships to the ships they escorted. (Other commentators note a distinct likeness to Shimamura Uzuki of iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls.)\n\nHagikaze wears clothing similar to other Kagerou-class destroyers, including a white blouse with a black vest, and a red neck ribbon. She also wears a black pleated skirt, white gloves, black thigh-highs, and loafers. Uncommonly for a destroyer, her breasts are more prominent and she can be seen to wear a purple bra when damaged.\n\nHer combat gear includes a twin-cannon turret held with two handles on the sides and a purse-like strap, with a backpack-like mount for a smokestack that carries swing-arms for more turrets. On her thighs, she has additional anti-air guns strapped in garter belt-like arrangements.\n\nShe's one of few girls with obvious Abyssal form, the Destroyer Water Demon. She holds a violet ribbon between her hands. This ribbon belongs to Kaga, and is a reference to how Hagikaze was the one who scuttled her at Midway. They also share the hairdo and Hagikaze was a reward for sinking her back in Fall 2015. Her line all reference the Battle of Vella Gulf where American destroyers ambushed Hagikaze's 4 destroyer convoy, with only Shigure surviving. Japanese didn't put as much as a dent on Americans and, aside Shigure's torpedoes, couldn't even return fire.", "popularity": 3404, "like": 3274, "trash": 3881, "likeCount": 91, "trashCount": 19, "isWaifu": true, "serie": "*/KanColle: Kantai Collection"},

Nicknamed “White 7” after the markings on her striker units, she was given the nickname \"North Pole Marseille\" (in reference to famed Karlsland ace Hanna-Justina Marseille) after a particularly successful set of sorties. Her Suomus friends often call her just \"Hasse\", similar to her ace archetype, Captain Hans Wind.\n\nThe number two super ace of the Suomus Air Force. Number one is Flying Officer Juutilainen of the 501st JFW. She's someone the new recruits always can rely on. She's a good leader, but she's not the kind of person who tries to force her subordinates to work, but rather someone who smilingly watches over them with a broad mind.\n\nAt the time of the beginning of the Neuroi invasion, she had no chance to sortie as a reserve officer, so she entered a military academy and received education as a regular aviation witch. After being assigned to the 24th Squadron as a Flying Officer, she was given the then state-of-the-art Beerster Buffalo to combat Neuroi. She gained experience and grew from a newly recruited witch to a dependable mid-career Officer, serving as the company commander.\n\nShe's an all-round fighter who has no weakness that seems to be a weak point, and has high capabilities in all aspects of air combat maneuvers, shooting, magical power, commanding ability, and enemy intelligence. She excels at shooting in particular and can use any kind of firearm skillfully, from pistols to anti-tank rifles. She is a valuable witch in Suomus, where equipment is normally in short supply, because she is trained to use all units and weapons freely. When compared to Eila, she is often referred to as \"Hanna the Marksman\" and \"Eila the Evasive\", although in Hanna's case her talents are more broad-reaching.\n\nDue to her skills, she has been asked to join both the 502nd and the 503rd, but since the recruits are so attached to her, and due to her own reasons, she has declined and stays in Suomus.\n\nHanna's close friendship with Nikka Edvardine Katajainen was solidified in an incident where a group of Neuroi one day approached Suomus airspace, and a large scale battle involving around ten witches followed. In that battle, Hanna was shot down and wounded as a result of Nikka's mistake. While the new recruits despaired at the sight of a top ace being shot down, and the situation seemed to be about to end in tragedy, Hanna shouted out some last words from the ground before losing consciousness.”We'll definitely win... because we have Nipa with us...” Nikka, previously uncooperative and prone to delinquency, was inspired. Battered, bruised and wounded, she brought all of the newly recruited witches back alive. In an awkward gesture of appreciation, Nikka later brought her a matching sweater in the hospital, a reference to their similar appearance and concreting their close friendship.\n\nShe later joined the newly reformed 507th Joint Fighter Wing in 1944. \n\nDespite her tomboyish appearance, Hanna is well-known and well-liked for her gentle, nurturing manner and soft smile. She is known for loving her country and her friends.\n\nThough she is close to all her squadmates, she shares an especially strong bond with Sergeant Nikka Katajainen, though this is only after some effort on Hanna's part to break through Nikka's rebellious exterior. Both look quite a bit alike, prompting Hanna to have the occasional bit of fun at Nikka's expense: she was once mistaken for the Sergeant during an inspection carried out by a highly ranked commissioned officer, where she just decided to play along and pretend she was Katajainen.", "popularity": 19899, "like": 18658, "trash": 21736, "likeCount": 5, "trashCount": 1, "isWaifu": true, "serie": "*/Strike Witches"},

She is a wealthy girl who attends Shujin Academy, and lives a double life as a Phantom Thief. She is the only daughter of Kunikazu Okumura, the Thieves' fifth major target.\n\n__Appearance__\nHaru has chin-length curly light auburn hair and brown eyes. She is of average height, being taller than Futaba, but shorter than Ann and Makoto.\n\nShe wears her winter school's uniform modified to her taste: a pink turtleneck cardigan with short puffed sleeves and a long-sleeved white shirt underneath. The cardigan is zipped open up to her navel and has two large pockets on the front. She wears the standard black and red tartan skirt, white tights with a black flower pattern and black Mary Jane shoes.\n\nHer summer school uniform retains her skirt and shoes, but she wears a light purple knitted sleeveless turtleneck sweater with a dark purple ribbon around her waist and white loose socks. Her summer casual outfit is a transparent greenish white collar dress underneath the white tank top, white pantyhose and cream-colored pumps. Her winter outfit is a white dress shirt with a dark blue ribbon, pale green fluffy coat, pink skirt, white tights and brown shoes.\n\nHer Thief outfit consists of a dark purple cavalier hat with a feather plume tucked into a royal purple hatband, a long-sleeved pale pink blouse with a white neck jabot (held there by a red gem pin), a black corset vest with gold buttons, bloomers that match her hatband, black pantyhose, a holster belt carrying ammo and lace-up pumps. Her mask and gloves are black and violet, respectively.\n\n__Personality__\nHaru is generally very shy and reserved. At school, she is viewed as eccentric due to her tendency to keep to herself and avoid contact with others as much as possible. She has serious trust issues, finding it difficult to differentiate between who truly values her as a friend, and who merely wants to use her for her family's status. This is due to her past, where not only friends, but adults and teachers would be kind at her just to please her father and smiled at her for their own personal gain. Despite this, Haru is an incredibly kind-hearted girl. She becomes fast friends with all of the Phantom Thieves, and is the only member of the group Ryuji Sakamoto doesn't argue with on a regular basis. She can also be very awkward, as shown when she first introduces herself to the others as \"Beauty Thief,\" and forgets parts of the script she has rehearsed with Morgana, to the point of saying \"We will take the Treasure.\" twice in a row, much to Futaba Sakura's ire. She later explains that she was trying to be a \"heroine of justice,\" having grown up admiring female superheroes she watched on TV. She loved them for always fighting to protect others and being happy, desiring to be just like them someday.\n\nInitially, Haru acts and behaves very formally towards the group, believing that it's her responsibility as the newest member of the team. After being told that whether or not she's new doesn't matter to them, however, she loosens up and becomes much more casual.\n\nIn her spare time, she enjoys tending to her garden, as well as growing vegetables on the roof of the school. She claims that vegetable-growing is the only thing she's honestly good at, and becomes delighted when she learns that her hobby can prove useful to the Phantom Thieves' activities. Besides gardening, she also enjoys horror movies. Despite her gentle personality, she admits she feels excited when Shadows beg for their lives, that cutting down enemies as they approach is a thrill, and that she sees combat as a form of stress relief, hinting she is somewhat sadistic. Also, after a battle, Haru may say something along the lines of, \"Phew, I need more of that!\" and despite saying that she gets nervous before combat, she always wants to do it again afterwards. Her sadistic streak is enough to freak out Makoto, who's well-known among the group for her vicious temper and tendency to take her anger out on Shadows. This sadistic side is further shown by the fact that if the protagonist cheats on her in Valentine's Day, she will express her anger with an eerie smile on her face, requesting that he take her chocolate before she crushes it.", "popularity": 627, "like": 600, "trash": 943, "likeCount": 422, "trashCount": 70, "isWaifu": true, "serie": "*/Persona 5 (Video Game)*/PERSONA5 the Animation"},

He is an idol with poor expression (in contrast to his twin Akihiko Beppu whose manners are good), but he has a harsh manner of speaking.\n\nHaving similar features to his older twin though he is the taller of the two by an inch or so. Haruhiko is seen to have a shade of light blue hair with striking crimson eyes which are different than his brother's fuchsia pink ones. He wears a light grey blazer with a white formal shirt beneath his blazer. A light golden coloured bow at the center of his shirt appears to be vertically tied around his neck, with a star symbol silver ring and a red jewel embedded, at the knot of the bow tie. Haruhiko's bangs appear to be swept onto the right-hand side.\n\nWhen he transforms he is called Salty Sol. His uniform is slightly different as his pants are shorter showing off skin and he also has no ruffled sleeves in his armband like his brother. Also his hat, sash, boots have the star symbol on it. Prior to their transform when the Twins start singing, Akihiko is close to Haruhiko's lap, also accentuating their difference in height. It should be noted that they have similar eye colour coordination with Gora and Yumoto Hakone. Gora has purple pink eyes and Yumoto has crimson eyes. In this way, Akihiko being the older brother has pink eyes whereas Haruhiko being the younger has crimson eyes.\n\nOf the twins Haruhiko is a bit more rowdy. He is more sharp tongued. Also, compared to his brother he is less fashionable as represented by his uniform being more classic minimalist than flashy as his older brother's. Even his transformation clothes are less flashy though they show a bit of skin indicating his more passionate side. His athleticism is so good he beats the most buffest member of Binan high school to push ups and strength tests. Though he considers \"beauty is strength\" and is physically and athletically more polished than his brother he also good at shogi and sewing - mental activities.\n\nThroughout the series Haruhiko, alongside his brother Akihiko, show contempt to the Battle Lovers especially Yumoto Hakone. This contempt also filters through their fans whom they call apes as though they are unrefined and have no value. Haruhiko prefers to do gardening and likes physical sports like horseriding (though in one episode in anger he clipped the branches of his bonsai tree.) Though, he is vicious and aggressive he is also pretty passive as he takes directions from his older brother more or less. Haruhiko shows more mean expressions such as teasing someone outright when they are miserable or showing anger and disdain more overtly. Unlike his brother, who can mask his expressions Haru actually has trouble doing that (hence Salty Sol). Though, he listens to his brother if directed not to be forthright with his emotions and expressions and takes the lead from him at times on how to behave.\n\nUnlike his brother, who seems to be more serious about idol work, or at least organised, Haruhiko, despite his strong exterior, likes intimacy. It is hinted he is a bit overprotective of his older brother and likes being intimate for people he likes.\n\nThe transformation in which Haruhiko is always paired with his older brother Akihiko along with using a microphone. Prior to their transform when the Twins start singing, Haruhiko has Akihiko close to his lap, also accentuating their difference in height.\n\nSalty Sol with his brother Melty Luna can summon a Loveless monster together. They do this by launching Dadacha at their victim, after which he latches himself to the victim's face and transforms the said victim into a loveless monster. He also seems to have powers somewhat over Fire and the Sun.\n\nSalty Sol uses a big pair of giant sun star symbol scissors, a reference to his bonsai gardening hobby that can also be used as his gardening tool to trim Bonsai trees when in concealed for. The scissors in their concealed form are also shown to be used as a shuriken boomerang to slice in half a button monsters weapon as shown in the OVA while returning to the thrower.

Out of respect to the memory of Hayato's parents, their old friend Fuga thereafter decided to adopt him and raise him as his own child.\n\nOwing to him being recognized as the most powerful Diviner in the Wind Tribe, Hayato thus desperately seeks to live up to his title, adopting a stiff, formal style of speech and attempting to conceal what he considers childish. As a result of this, he often comes across as being rather condescending and rude in his treatment of others, a fact that is reflected throughout a good number of supports that he shares with other characters. Hayato's snobbish attitude is, however, a mask for the adolescent form that continues to live within him, one that he accidentally makes known to the world from time to time. It is through the emergence of these childish tendencies that more dimensions to his personality can be observed.\n\nFor one, Hayato possesses an innate curiosity about the world around him, easily fascinated by things that are unfamiliar to him. His supports with Azura best exemplify this, where he, in a fit of excitement, informs her of his admiration for the vastness of the world outside of the Wind Tribe. He is also known to possess a sweet tooth, one that he deems to be disgraceful; through his supports with Sakura, he initially refuses her offer to share her mochi with him, only accepting when she comes up with the idea of pretending that he is helping her to finish them if they're asked about it.\n\nHayato has also been revealed to be an insecure person, possessing quite a few phobias that include the dark and the supernatural, one that are known to reduce him to tears due to him not being able to maintain a stable frame of mind when confronted with both. His supports with Azama is an example of this fact, where a tale that Azama shares of a ghost living in a closet is perceived to be terrifying enough to cause Hayato to break out into a peal of uncontrollable sobs. Hayato also detests appearing weak in front of others and failing to achieve success in his spellcasting. As shown in a Private Quarters conversation, Hayato is afraid of the dark.\n\nHayato is fairly skilled as an apothecary, having numerous rare herbs and can also turn them into potions. His supports with Orochi show that he is more potent in making a healing potion and presumably a salve for tooth rot, though Orochi surpasses him in cold medicine.\n\nHayato is said to be the one who drinks the most milk in the army.", "popularity": 17634, "like": 19781, "trash": 10912, "likeCount": 4, "trashCount": 6, "isWaifu": false, "serie": "*/Fire Emblem"},

She is the queen of Hel and the mother of Eir.\n\nHel's armies begin attacking Askr, and Hel sends her daughter, Eir, to infiltrate the Order of Heroes, gain their trust, and kill them on her command.\n\nIn Chapter 3, according to King Gustav, Hel fought him in a battle, only for Gustav to escape after she gave him a scar on his face. Then, Hel confronts the Order of Heroes and is defeated. However, she quickly recovers and curses Alfonse, stating that he will die in nine days and that he cannot escape his fate. Gustav indicates that Hel took his own father's life with the same curse.\n\nAt the end of Chapter 4, the countdown ends and Hel arrives to take Alfonse's life. However just before she can succeed, Gustav arrives at the last minute and takes the fatal blow meant for his son, fulfilling the curse and saving Alfonse at the cost of his own life.\n\nIn the middle of Chapter 6, Hel appears once more, and attempts to curse Alfonse a second time following the battle. However, following Alfonse's declaration that he will find a way to defeat Hel before the 9 days were up, she rescinded her curse, and vowed to make him suffer in ways he couldn't imagine. She appears before Eir after this, once again informing Eir that she will betray the Order once she gives the order. Eir doesn't wish to do this, stating that she dreams of a time when Hel smiled at her. Hel disregards this, saying Eir will follow her orders no matter what.\n\nIn Chapter 13, Hel gives her order to Eir, to which Eir reluctantly complies. After she seemly completes the task by killing Kiran, Hel reveals that Eir is not really her daughter. In truth Eir came from a world of dragons when Hel kidnapped her and altered her memories just so she can obtain more power. However right she's about to kill her it's revealed that Kiran somehow survived, the Order of Heroes tricked her and she retreats to her castle. After a lengthily final battle, Hel attempts to escape, but Veronica uses Angrbooa's Heart and performs the Heart's Rite, and then Kiran dealt the finishing blow to Hel with their two Breidabliks, completely killing her. Before she expires, Eir comforts her and says that although she was not her daughter, the love she felt was real.", "popularity": 19231, "like": 23336, "trash": 11543, "likeCount": 2, "trashCount": 5, "isWaifu": true, "serie": "*/Fire Emblem"},
